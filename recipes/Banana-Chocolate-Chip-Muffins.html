        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The right muffin can save your day. It can pull you out of a hungry slump or provide a good jolt of sugar and nutrients in the morning.
            If you’re looking for something that twists a classic, this recipe for banana chocolate chip muffins does just that. 
            The recipe includes plain yogurt and bananas, so the result will be a soft muffin with great moisture.
            Banana muffins taste similar to banana bread—and very ripe bananas, like banana bread, will work best for this recipe.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix oil, yogurt, egg, and vanilla together in a separate bowl until well combined; stir into flour mixture until smooth. Gently fold in mashed bananas and chocolate chips. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 22 to 25 minutes. Cool briefly in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
